## Getting Involved

### What's being worked on now

The core team tracks what is currently being worked on on the [Zazu Project
Board][Zazu Project Board].

### Zazu Core

You can also look through currently open issues in Zazu Core. Often, the ones
not being worked on are marked with a [help wanted][help wanted tag]. tag.

### Plugins

Plugin development is also a great way to get involved. Zazu needs plugin to do
anything useful for a user. If you create one, start the repo name with `zazu-`
and feel free to submit it to the plugin directory once you get it working! If
you need help getting started there is documentation on [creating a
plugin][plugin page].

## Community

You can find the community and core developers on [Gitter Chat][Gitter Chat].

## Core Team Guidelines

If you're part of Zazu's core team there are a few guidelines for you as well.

When starting work, please update the [Zazu Project Board][Zazu Project Board]
with your current task. When you create a pull request, add a reviewer who is
also on the core team.

If you get added as a reviewer and you don't have time to get to it in the next
day or two, feel free to comment or re-assign the ticket, things come up, we
understand! [:

If there is no reviewer on a pull request, from a non-core member for example,
assign it to yourself and take it from there.

Lastly, if you approve of the change, merge the pull request yourself.
